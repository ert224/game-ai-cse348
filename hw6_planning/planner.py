### Return true if the given state object is a goal. Goal is a State object too.
def is_goal(state, goal):
  return len(goal.propositions.difference(state.propositions)) == 0

### Return true if the given state is in a set of states.
def state_in_set(state, set_of_states):
  for s in set_of_states:
    if s.propositions != state.propositions:
      return False

### For debugging, print each state in a list of states
def print_states(states):
  for s in states:
    ca = None

### Planner 
###
### The planner knows how to generate a plan using a-star and heuristic search planning.
### It also knows how to execute plans in a continuous, time environment.

class Planner():

  def __init__(self):
    self.running = False              # is the planner running?
    self.world = None                 # pointer back to the world
    self.the_plan = []                # the plan (when generated)
    self.initial_state = None         # Initial state (State object)
    self.goal_state = None            # Goal state (State object)
    self.actions = []                 # list of actions (Action objects)

  ### Start running
  def start(self):
    self.running = True
    
  ### Stop running
  def stop(self):
    self.running = False

  ### Called every tick. Executes the plan if there is one
  def update(self, delta = 0):
    result = False # default return value
    if self.running and len(self.the_plan) > 0:
      # I have a plan, so execute the first action in the plan
      self.the_plan[0].agent = self
      result = self.the_plan[0].execute(delta)
      if result == False:
        # action failed
        print("AGENT FAILED")
        self.the_plan = []
      elif result == True:
        # action succeeded
        done_action = self.the_plan.pop(0)
        print("ACTION", done_action.name, "SUCCEEDED")
        done_action.reset()
    # If the result is None, the action is still executing
    return result

  ### Call back from Action class. Pass through to world
  def check_preconditions(self, preconds):
    if self.world is not None:
      return self.world.check_preconditions(preconds)
    return False

  ### Call back from Action class. Pass through to world
  def trigger(self, action):
    if self.world is not None:
      return self.world.trigger(action)

  ### Generate a plan. Init and goal are State objects. Actions is a list of Action objects
  ### Return the plan and the closed list
  def astar(self, init, goal, actions):
      plan = []    # the final plan
      open = []    # the open list (priority queue) holding State objects
      closed = []  # the closed list (already visited states). Holds state objects
      ### YOUR CODE GOES HERE

      ### CODE ABOVE
      return plan, closed

  ### Compute the heuristic value of the current state using the HSP technique.
  ### Current_state and goal_state are State objects.
  def compute_heuristic(self, current_state, goal_state, actions):
    actions = copy.deepcopy(actions)  # Make a deep copy just in case
    h = 0                             # heuristic value to return
